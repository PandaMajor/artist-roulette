This is a personal project I built to host the game for my friends.

## The Rules  
---

An artist is randomly selected from the list. For 24 hours you can only listen to music by the selected artist for a minimum of 2 hours total a day. Additonally, any tracks that feature the artist is fair game and can be listened to for the challenge. The goal is to discover new discography for a week.

# Technologies used

- Figma
- React
- Next.js
- Tailwind CSS
- Google Firebase

# The Process

First, I created an initial prototype of the project in Figma to layout what I wanted the end result to look like along with some of it's functionality that can be viewed in the prototype. 

After creating a reference for the project, I decided to build it using React and Tailwind CSS so that the end product could be responsive.

For the backend database, I wanted to use Google Firebase so that it could be remotely accessed.

Finally, I decided to host the website using Vercel as it is streamlined with Next.js projects.

You can see the end product here: https://artist-roulette.vercel.app/
